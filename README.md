# Password Generator

## Description

This project was created in order to provide the user with a random generated password containing certain criteria. With many things online a strong unique password is necessary for online safety. During this project i learned how difficult it is to be truly random using a computer.

## Installation

Make your way to the live website and click the generate password button. After that, the website will guide you through a series of prompts and generate a unique random password. Down below is an image of a randomly generated password from the live website which can be found here https://abasheryassin.github.io/password-generator/

## Credits

In this project, I used two functions that i found during research that are linked down below. The first function checks to see if a string contains only digits. The second function randomly suffels a given string.
